# êÇÉ Subterfuge
Learning TypeScript the Temu way!

# What's this?
This program's purpose is to restrict your TypeScript down to just console.log and functions. After completing "problems" (similar to LeetCode), you gain money. With money, you buy features. To complete the game, you need to solve all (10) problems.

You must buy features before using them.

You can get the Premium version of the Battle Pass by supporting me on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/facedevstuff). But if you don't want to, the code is available in plain sight in the source code. ;)

Banner ads are there to embrace the feeling of gamifying your learning.

While running your code, you have a 10% of being interrupted by a spinning wheel of coupons.

# FAQ
- Dude I'm stuck at...
  - The `tasks/` folder contains the solutions for each problem. Please peek at it only if you REALLY can't figure out the answers.
- Why did my `main.ts` get deleted??
  - Once your solution passes, it is moved to `.history/{0..100000}main.ts`. The active file however get's rewritten with the boilerplate for the next problem.
- How do I get money?
  - The prices are designed to revolve around giving you exactly how much you need for the feature required in the next problem, and so on. If you've spent money on a feature you don't need, you can go in `/src/data/savedata.json` and modify the "money" property. It isn't recommended as it may alter your gaming experience. Otherwise, you can get money from *problems* and *battlepass*.
- How is the BP XP calculated?
  - problem money / 1.5
- How many problems are there?
  - 10
- Can I contribute?
  - The structure for adding problems is quite intuitive, so if you wish you can open a pull request with a new problem in `savedata.json`. Please also include the solution inside `tasks/`.
